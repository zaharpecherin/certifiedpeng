        The team have been delivering technology platforms and digital marketing
        campaigns for clients such as NHS Choices, Disney, Adidas and Nike, Volvo,
        Barclaycard, NBC Universal, AOL, and Pepsi. We have put all this fancy on
        the job experience and book learning into the Certified Peng platform - a

        millennial demographic, but pengness is not ageist - we love everybody.
